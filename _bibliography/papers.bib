abstract = {Stomatal conductance (gs) quantifies the rate of exchange of carbon dioxide for photosynthesis and water vapor for transpiration between plant leaves and the atmosphere. gs is usually measured by handheld devices like porometers, and readings are manually taken in the field, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this study, we investigated the use of high-throughput phenotyping (HTP) data combined with weather data to estimate gs through machine-learning (ML) modeling. The experiment was conducted in a research field equipped with an HTP platform in 2020 and 2021 involving maize, sorghum, soybean, sunflower, and winter wheat. Weather variables including dew point temperature, wind speed, air temperature, solar radiation, and relative humidity were collected by an onsite weather station. Plot-level canopy temperature, soil temperature, and seven vegetation indices were acquired using a thermal infrared camera, a multispectral camera, and a visible near-infrared spectrometer integrated on the HTP platform. Three supervised ML methods (Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), Random Forest Regression (RFR), and Support Vector Regression (SVR)) were employed to train the estimation models for gs, and model performance was evaluated by Coefficient of Determination (R2) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The result showed that RFR and SVR outperformed PLSR in gs modeling. The RFR model achieved R2 of 0.63 and RMSE of 0.16 mol m−2·s−1 with the combination of phenotyping data and weather data. It outperformed the model using only the weather data (R2=0.35 and RMSE=0.21 mol m−2·s−1), or the model using only the phenotyping data (R2=0.46 and RMSE=0.19 mol m−2·s−1). This result suggested that high-throughput plant phenotyping data effectively complement weather data in estimating gs rapidly and non-destructively through ML. With the wide adoption of HTP technologies in aerial and ground-based platforms, this research provides a practical framework to estimate gs at large scale for crop breeding and irrigation management.},

abstract = {As the global population continues to increase, the demand for food production rises accordingly. The water availability  of crops has a significant impact on their yield during the processes of photosynthesis and transpiration. Crops exchange  carbon dioxide and water with the atmosphere through stomata. When crops undergo water stress, they tend to close their  stomata to reduce water loss. However, this can also negatively affect the crop's photosynthetic rate and carbon  assimilation, leading to low yields. Stomatal conductance (SC) quantifies the rate of gas exchange between crops and the  atmosphere and can inform the crop's water status. SC measurements require the use of contact-type instruments, which is  time-consuming and labor-intensive. This study examined the accuracy of multiple linear regression (MLR), support vector  regression (SVR), and convolutional neural network (CNN) models for SC estimation in corn and soybean using RGB,  near-infrared, and thermal-infrared images from a field phenotyping platform. The results show that the CNN model  outperformed other two models, with R 2 value of 0.52. Furthermore, adding soil moisture as a variable to the model  improved its accuracy, decreasing model RMSE from 0.147 to 0.137 mol/(m2*s). This study highlights the potential of  estimating SC from remote sensing platforms to help growers obtain information about their crop water status and plan  irrigation more effectively. },
